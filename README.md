# NetBox LibreNMS Plugin

This plugin provides the ability to sync selected data between Netbox and LibreNMS.

The plugin allows Netbox to remain the source of truth by allowing intentional syncing of data between NetBox and LibreNMS. The intention is to make it easier to maintain accurate data between the two systems.

This is in early development.

## Features

The plugin offers the following key features:

### Interface Synchronization
Pull interface data from LibreNMS into NetBox. The following interface attributes are synchronized:
- Name
- Description
- Status (Enabled/Disabled)
- Type (with custom mapping support)**
- Speed
- MTU
- MAC Address

** Set custom mappings for interface types to ensure that the correct interface type is used when syncing from LibreNMS to NetBox. 

### Site & Location Synchronization
The plugin also supports synchronizing NetBox Sites with LibreNMS locations:
- Compare NetBox sites to LibreNMS location data
- Create LibreNMS locations to match NetBox sites
- Update existing LibreNMS locations langitude and longitude values based on NetBox data
- Sync device site to LibreNMS location

## Contributing
There's more to do! Coding is not my day job. Bugs will exist and imporvements will be needed. So contributions are very welcome!  I've got more ideas for new features and imporvements but please [contribute](docs/contributing.md) if you can!

Or just share your ideas for the plugin over in [discussions](https://github.com/bonzo81/netbox-librenms-plugin/discussions ).
